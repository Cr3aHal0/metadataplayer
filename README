This is the README for MetaDataPlayer, an opensource web player with metadata support.

Features
========

    o Reads json-converted cinelab metadata
    o Reads from Youtube, Dailymotion and Flash backends
    o Loads the data as JSON as well as JSONP
    

Requirements
============

- jQuery 1.4
- jQuery UI 1.4

Building the library
====================

The library files are scattered in many files. An ant build script has been made to make the developer and
minified versions of the player. It is located in sbin/build/client.xml.

Running the examples
====================

You'll have to have a web server configured to serve the metadataplayer directory, because
of the flash cross-domain policy.
